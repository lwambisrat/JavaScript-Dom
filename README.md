# Greens Kiosk

This project(Greens Kiosk) is a responsive web page for a fictional fruits and vegetables shop. It showcases a visually appealing and mobile-friendly landing page where users can see a navigation menu, a welcome section, and separate sections for fruits and vegetables. Both the fruit and vegetable lists are dynamically updated using JavaScript, allowing new items (like "Pineapples" for fruits and "Spinach" for vegetables) to be added and displayed interactively. The design adapts to different screen sizes, ensuring a good user experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
